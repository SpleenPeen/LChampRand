# LChampRand
Simple app inspired by Elo.rip with a customizable champion pool and user defined character roles.
Randomly generate a character based on lane, or select All for any.

To open the application simply extract the zip file and run the exe.

Do mind, the application only minimizes on close.
To fully exit the app, either right click on the tray icon and select close or press 'Alt + F4'
(or just wait for it to crash, however unlikely)
